DESCRIPTION::
Hail allows decentralised automatic discovery of other participants in a Utopia based network music application. It does this by broadcasting a 'hailing signal' consisting of a specified OSC path ('/hail' by default). It automatically adds and informs new Peers, and tracks online status, marking unresponsive Peers as offline.

By using different OSC paths multiple subnetworks can exist on the same physical network. Each participant in a subnetwork should created a Hail with the same path. Since it is decentralised, it does not depend on any one node remaining stable and online.

Hail holds an link::Classes/AddrBook:: as an instance variable. Users can pass this to other Utopia objects, and know that it will be updated as appropriate. Thus Hail can fufill the role of membership management in a Utopia based system or subsystem.


CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: new
Create a new Hail.

ARGUMENT:: addrBook
An optional link::Classes/AddrBook:: which this instance will use to store discovered link::Classes/Peer::s. Users can pass this to other Utopia objects, and know that it will be updated as appropriate. If nil, one will be automatically created.

ARGUMENT:: period
The interval in seconds between 'hailing signals' being sent. Peers which have not responded for > (2 * period) seconds will be marked offline.

ARGUMENT:: me
An optional link::Classes/Peer:: representing the localhost. If nil one will be automatically created using link::Classes/AddrBook#-addMe::.

ARGUMENT:: authenticator
An optional authenticator, which is used to authenticate other Peers attempting to join the system. This should be an instance of a subclass of link::Classes/NMLAbstractAuthenticator::, such as link::Classes/ChallengeAuthenticator:: or link::Classes/GroupPasswordAuthenticator::. If nil  Hail will create an instance of link::Classes/NonAuthenticator:: (no authentication). 

ARGUMENT:: oscPath
An OSC compliant path in the form of a link::Classes/Symbol:: or link::Classes/String:: used to identify this subnetwork. By using different paths multiple subnetworks can exist on the same physical network. In simple cases the default ('/hail') can be used.

returns:: A new Hail instance.


INSTANCEMETHODS::

private:: checkOnline, makeOSCFuncs, init, hailingSignal

METHOD:: addrBook
Get this Hail's link::Classes/AddrBook::. This can be passed to other Utopia objects.

returns:: An link::Classes/AddrBook::.

METHOD:: free
Free this object and its link::Classes/OSCFunc::s. After this, this Hail (and probably its AddrBook) should not be used.
